# GitHub Action to use AWS CLI

This simple action uses the [vanilla AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html) to sync a directory (either from your repository or generated during your workflow) with a remote S3 bucket.


## Usage

### `workflow.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

As of v0.1.1, all [`aws` flags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/) are optional to allow for maximum customizability (that's a word, I promise) and must be provided by you via `args:`.

```yaml
name: AWS CLI to S3

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: alboompro/action-awscli@0.1.1
      with:
        args: s3 ls
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: 'us-west-1'   # optional: defaults to us-east-1
```


### Configuration

The following settings must be passed as environment variables as shown in the example. Sensitive information, especially `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) â€” otherwise, they'll be public to anyone browsing your repository's source code and CI logs.
